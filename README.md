## Overview

Google reCaptcha v3 is designed to distinguish human users from automated systems by analyzing user behavior and assigning a score between 0.0 and 1.0. This invisible CAPTCHA method enhances user experience by eliminating disruptive challenges while maintaining robust security. In this guide, we'll explore how to solve reCaptcha v3 and achieve a high human-like score (0.7-0.9) using CapSolver and Puppeteer.

## How Does reCaptcha v3 Work?

reCaptcha v3 operates by monitoring user interactions such as mouse movements and typing patterns. It assigns a score based on these interactions to determine whether the user is a human or a bot:

- **Score Range**: 0.0 (most likely a bot) to 1.0 (definitely human).
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue.js.

### Key Features

- **Invisible Challenge**: Unlike previous versions, reCaptcha v3 does not interrupt users with interactive challenges.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Evaluates user behavior to assign a score.
- **Customizable Threshold**: Adjust the score threshold based on security needs.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: Install the latest version from the official website.
- **[Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/)**: A Node.js library for controlling headless Chrome.
- **[CapSolver API Key](https://www.capsolver.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=recaptchascore)**: Obtain an API key for CAPTCHA-solving services.

    "clientKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "task": {
        "type": "ReCaptchaV3TaskProxyLess",
        "websiteURL": "https://example.com",
        "websiteKey": "6LdyC2cUAAAAACGuDKpXeDorzUDWXmdqeg-xy696",
